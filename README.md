Good job on the purpose/audience/goal and Persona and Use Case for this project. You definitely have a clear idea of what kind of website you will be creating, and for whom (RPG and their fans). Your HTML looks great, however there are some problems with your directory structure. See below. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Be sure to correct the issues with the project noted below before Milestone 2a is due. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits/Suggestions
There are a few issues with your Directory structure
- Add <code>/vendor</code> to line 3 of your .gitignore file
- Refer to the correct directory structure for PWP here in the [Milestone 1 documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/). Update this project to match before submitting Milestone 2a.
